        <p>For <a target="_blank" href="http://flamin.filmlondon.org.uk">FLAMIN</a>, the organisation behind <i>Selected 5</i>, it's all about showcasing films that resist 'conventional definition'. It's true that, when I'm writing about experimental works. It's hard to shake off a sense of inadequacy as a critic: qualitative assessments of an experience feel less useful, or lack conviction, more often than is usual.</p>

        <p>Do these select films only appeal to an elite few? Rather, they introduce us — that is, anybody — to something else with minimal exposition, leaving behind a unique imprint (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sodajerk.com.au/">Soda_Jerk</a>, who had a residency at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fact.co.uk/">FACT</a> recently, told me this was something their work also aspires to do).</p>

        <p><i>Selected</i> takes a no compromise approach and throws viewers in at the deep end, which, as it turns out, is a fun place to be. Projects like <a target="_blank" href="http://flamin.filmlondon.org.uk/jarman_home">Jarman Award</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://jerwoodfvuawards.com/">Jerwood/FVU</a> and <i>Selected</i> can remind us that films can have a sense of spontaneity and reveal artists at play, taking risks.</p></section>

        <p>Despite many exciting developments in digital film production, suspicion surrounds works produced by a single person. There’s a notion that they’re self-indulgent exercises with little benefit for anyone, least of all your average cinema audience.</p>

        <p>Compared with making feature films, time comes at a smaller price for producers of experimental shorts, but that doesn't mean it's cheap. It was interesting to consider how circumstances of production affected the <i>Selected</i> films; sometimes they were just another aspect that made the work more personal. It became clear that the ability to do much of the work without the need for collaboration is as liberating for creative impulses as it is technically limiting.</p></section>

        <section><header><h3 id="Repeat_Showings">Repeat Showings</h3></header>
        <p>A few of the films shown as part of <i>Selected 5</i> are freely available on the web, to be unearthed somewhere among those images of ‘your face, online, photoshopped on a llama’s body, in perpetuity’ (as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.anitadelaney.net/">Anita Delaney</a>'s film <i>A rat biting another rat</i> puts it). The films are a precious resource, requiring only a few minutes of your time but possessing considerable ‘replay value’.</p>

        <p>In <a target="_blank" href="http://nickbrooks.info/">Nicholas Brooks</a>' <i>Friendly things from the future</i>, every day a woman digs up a pulsing pink torus in her garden, time and again and impossibly. With each re-discovery the object requires less cleaning off and is ‘a little more perfect’. An object-text being lost and found again is figured as a kind of restorative, or even generative, process which fosters meaning and coherence. Similarly, by the end of the evening, I could go home and watch these films again, in a different context and at my convenience. I’d see something else, or forget why I reacted in a certain way in the cinema.</p></section>

          <header><h3 id="Sprawl">Virtual Realities, Natural Sanctuaries and the Sprawl</h3></header>
            <p>Many of the artists featured in <i>Selected 5</i> are London-based, perhaps out of necessity. I wonder if living in a metropolis, or at any rate in a world increasingly stretched for free space and time, provokes people to make short video works. Collectively, these films questioned the capacity of on-screen realms, and of spiritual fantasies, to compensate for the spoilage and pillage of non-virtual sanctuaries around us. Min-Wei Ting’s <i>You’re Dead to Me</i> featured long, intense shots of the artist walking, sometimes lying among graves in a large cemetery in Singapore. He remarked that, since shooting the film, the site's been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/aug/07/land-starved-singapore-exhumes-its-cemeteries-to-build-roads-and-malls">carved up</a> to make way for the construction of a new highway.</p>

            <p>Primeval forests mesh with built environments in a number of the other works, too. In Niels Bugge’s <i>Gott mit uns</i>, it’s a landscaped wood that serves as an eagle enclosure in a Glasgow zoo; while in Nicholas Brooks’ <i>Friendly things from the future</i>, we inspect smooth-carved stone sculptures in a landscape whose towering structures — concrete dreams, like the surviving follies of some real-world Jurassic Park — stand watch amid canopies and scrub, reclaimed.</p></section>

        <p><i>Selected 5</i> archives too-familiar apocalyptic worlds (described by Charles Bukowski in <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/68860960">Richard Sides</a>' film, for example) as well as sentimental memories of the past (as in <a target="_blank" href="http://thomaslock.com">Thomas Lock</a>'s <i>Memory Theatre</i>). These are reflected through myriad screens, recording formats, interfaces that appeal to our senses with a corrupted mirror-image of ourselves. We are shown a network of things: media with a frightening awareness of human vulnerability, carrying out a kind of digital necromancy of human thoughts, feelings and histories. Grotesque but not entirely unappealing, there it is in front of us and continuing without us.</p></section>
